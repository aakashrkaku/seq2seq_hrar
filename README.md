### Dataset
The StrokeRehab IMU dataset, including its data splits, are available on https://simtk.org/projects/primseq. For the public dataset such as breakfast and 50salads, please check the the official code from [ASRF](https://github.com/yiskw713/asrf)

For benchmark datasets, we follow the same setting as ASRF for data splits.
